I am finding this really tough.

STARTING POINT
I have decided to use the previous homework in week 2 - being Bootstrap - as the base html for my homepage for the quiz. 
I did this because it has the containers and also re-sizes nicely for all screen size types so I did not have to reinvent the wheel.
I have managed to change this to work as I wanted it to, that being:
Its a home page telling about the quiz.
It has buttons that link to the high scores and quiz pages.
I think that this might not be the way to do it but just want to show I understand the steps as per my flow chart/pseudo code.
The pseudo codes is in multiple jpg files called:
pseudo1pages.jpg
pseudo2pages.jpg
pseudo3quizflow.jpg
pseudo4quizflowmore.jog


THE PROCESS OF ATTEMPTING TO CREATE THE QUIZ
I dont think I'm doing this the right way but trying to show that I undestand what needs to be done alberi I am struggling to put it all together.

I decided to Google timers and also quizzes to get some help. I have acknowledged this in the Java Script file.

Theres quite a few test files "Kwiz" in Git Hub as I thought it best to muck around first.
