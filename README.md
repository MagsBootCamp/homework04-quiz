CODE QUIZ

STARTING POINT
I have decided to use the previous homework in week 2 - being Bootstrap - as the base html for my homepage for the quiz. 
I did this because it has the containers and is responsive to multiple screen sizes, so I did not have to reinvent the wheel.
I have managed to change this to work - being:
A home page introducing the quiz, that has buttons that link to the high scores and quiz pages.
I think that this might not be the way to do it but just want to show I understand the steps as per my flow chart/pseudo code.
The pseudo code/flow chart is in multiple jpg files:

<img src="pseudo2pages.jpg" alt="page 2 of pseudo/flowchart">
<img src="pseudo3quizflow.jpg" alt="page 3 of pseudo/flowchart">
<img src="pseudo4quizflowmore.jpg" alt="page 4 of pseudo/flowchart">
<img src="pseudo5summaryofneeds.jpg" alt="page 5 of pseudo/flowchart">


If the above doesnt work......

THE PROCESS OF ATTEMPTING TO CREATE THE QUIZ
I dont think I'm doing this the right way but trying to show that I undestand what needs to be done albeit I am struggling to put it all together.
I decided to Google timers and also quizzes to get some help. I have acknowledged this in the Java Script file.
Theres quite a few test files "Kwiz" in Git Hub as I thought it best to try various options first.
